# Glioma-Grading-using-Machine-Learning-techniques-Model-optimization-and-web-deployment

This project aims to Optimize ML models and deploy the best ML algorithm using Streamlit for Glioma grading tumors.

The project has been done in collaboration with [Dieu-Donne Fangnon](https://github.com/dfangnon), [Phanie Dianelle Negho](https://github.com/PhanieDianelle) and [Solafa Fadlallah](https://github.com/Solafa11).

The app can be tested using this [link](https://gliomaprediction.streamlit.app/)

We are currently working on the paper which will be released soon.
